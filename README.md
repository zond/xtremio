# Xtremio

A native, cross-platform **Stremio client** built on a pure-Rust core with a Flutter UI.

Xtremio is the client half of a two-part project. The other half is
[`zond/stream-server`](https://github.com/zond/stream-server) — a pure-Rust,
headless, zero-external-binary torrent-streaming server. Xtremio pairs that
with [`stremio-core`](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-core) (the official
Rust engine for addons, catalogs, library, and playback state) and
[`media_kit`](https://pub.dev/packages/media_kit)/libmpv for playback.

> **Status:** early scaffold. Right now this is a responsive app shell; the
> Rust integration and real screens are being built out.

## Architecture

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Flutter UI (this repo) — screens, navigation, playback UI   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Dart ⇄ Rust FFI                                             │
│   • stremio-core   → addons, catalogs, search, library,      │
│                      account, playback state (the "brain")   │
│   • stream-server  → torrent/archive bytes over local HTTP   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  media_kit / libmpv — decodes & renders the video the        │
│  server streams (direct play; codecs & subtitles on-device)  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The UI stays thin: discovery/library/addon logic lives in `stremio-core`, the
bytes come from `stream-server`, and the client's job is presentation plus
driving libmpv. Because a capable on-device player handles codecs and
subtitles, the server never transcodes — it just gets bytes onto an HTTP
connection.

## Platform support

The hard constraint is **BitTorrent**: the streaming path needs raw TCP/UDP
sockets, a local HTTP server, disk cache, and libmpv. That decides everything.

| Platform | Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux (desktop)** | ✅ First-class | Flutter desktop + media_kit + native Rust. Easiest target. |
| **Windows (desktop)** | ✅ First-class | Same as Linux. |
| **macOS (desktop)** | ✅ First-class | Native Rust + media_kit; needs a Mac to build. |
| **Android** | ✅ Supported | Rust cross-compiles to the NDK; embedded as a native lib. Proven by existing Stremio clients. Primary mobile target. |
| **iOS** | ⚠️ With effort | Rust + media_kit build for iOS, but: background execution is throttled (a torrent server suspends when backgrounded), and **the App Store is out** (App Store terms are incompatible with GPL-3, which the shipped binary is — see License). Sideload / TestFlight / AltStore only. |
| **Web** | ❌ Not possible | A browser **cannot do BitTorrent** — no raw sockets (only HTTP/WebSocket/WebRTC), so the torrent swarm is unreachable, and there's no way to run a local server or libmpv. WebTorrent only reaches the tiny WebRTC-capable subset of peers. The only "web" that works is a *thin client talking to a separate streaming server* (the stremio-web model) — a different architecture, not this app. |

**Short version:** desktop and Android are the real targets, iOS works if you
sideload and accept the background limits, and web is fundamentally off the
table for a self-contained streaming client.

## Getting started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux      # or -d windows, -d macos, or an Android device
```

Linux desktop needs `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, and GTK 3 dev libraries;
Android needs the Android SDK/NDK.

## License

The **source** in this repository is MIT (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Note that a
**compiled** Xtremio binary that embeds the default build of `stream-server`
links `unrar-rs` (GPL-3.0-or-later), so distributed binaries are covered by
GPL-3.0-or-later. This is intentional and fine for open distribution; it is
also why the iOS App Store is not a target. (A build without RAR support keeps
the binary MIT.)
